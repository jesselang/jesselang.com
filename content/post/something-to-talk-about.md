Life has a way of bringing you full circle. Many circles
in fact. My intentions are humble this time around. I want
to share pieces of my life, what I'm doing, and what I'm
learning, in hopes that someone can also learn from it.
I've chosen the school of experience over a formal
education, not an easy road to take, but it has served
me adequately, and I can say that there is no substitute
for experience. And there's no better someone to learn
from than someone with that experience.
